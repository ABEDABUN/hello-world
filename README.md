# hello-world

Hi fellow diginauts!

I'm Abedabun. I'm new to coding. I've stumbled upon it whilst doing some career surfing one night and I've finally took one small step for me, one giant step for mankind!

I was living in Thailand for the past three and a half years teaching English. Now I've relocated to Ireland where I am looking for new adventures and focusing on teaching myself new skills.

I LOVE the outdoors!!! Anything from fishing, free diving, surfing to hiking and climbing.

I'm looking forward to making the acquaintance with fellow coders. If you're new like me or if you've been doing it for years.

It's something that I am facinated about!! I have finally found my CALLING!!!

Over and out!# hello-world
